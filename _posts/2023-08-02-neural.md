I was recently looking at examples of using neural networks from the Hugging Face Candle library and noticed that they are quite difficult to understand for people who are just starting to get acquainted with neural networks. Therefore, I decided to write the most simplified sample code in Rust, which demonstrates the training and use of the simplest neural network.

In my example, the neural network is trying to predict whether the first candidate will win in the second round of voting, based on the results of the first round.

Of course, the predictive power of such a simple model is not great, but I think this example does a good job of demonstrating the basic principles of training and using neural networks in the most simplistic way. I hope this article will help newcomers to the field of machine learning to better understand how neural networks work!


1. I am using a multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers. The first hidden layer has 4 neurons, the second has 2 neurons.
2. The input is a vector of 2 numbers — the percentage of votes for the first and second candidates in the first stage.
3. The output is the number 0 or 1, where 1 means that the first candidate will win in the second stage, 0 means that he will lose.
4. For training, samples with “real” data on the results of the first and second stages of different elections are used.
5. The model is trained by backpropagation using gradient descent and the cross-entropy loss function.
6. Model parameters (weights of neurons) are initialized randomly, then optimized during training.
7. After training, the model is tested on a deferred sample to evaluate the accuracy.
8. If the accuracy on the test set is below 100%, the model is considered underfit and the learning process is repeated.

Thus, this neural network learns to find hidden relationships between the results of the first and second rounds of voting in order to make predictions for new data.

How it looks in code:

```rust
const VOTE_DIM: usize = 2;
const RESULTS: usize = 1;
const EPOCHS: usize = 20;
const LAYER1_OUT_SIZE: usize = 4;
const LAYER2_OUT_SIZE: usize = 2;
const LEARNING_RATE: f64 = 0.05;

struct MultiLevelPerceptron {
    ln1: Linear,
    ln2: Linear,
    ln3: Linear,
}

impl MultiLevelPerceptron {
    fn new(vs: VarBuilder) -> Result<Self> {
        let ln1 = candle_nn::linear(VOTE_DIM, LAYER1_OUT_SIZE, vs.pp("ln1"))?;
        let ln2 = candle_nn::linear(LAYER1_OUT_SIZE, LAYER2_OUT_SIZE, vs.pp("ln2"))?;
        let ln3 = candle_nn::linear(LAYER2_OUT_SIZE, RESULTS + 1, vs.pp("ln3"))?;
        Ok(Self { ln1, ln2, ln3 })
    }

    fn forward(&self, xs: &Tensor) -> Result<Tensor> {
        let xs = self.ln1.forward(xs)?;
        let xs = xs.relu()?;
        let xs = self.ln2.forward(&xs)?;
        let xs = xs.relu()?;
        self.ln3.forward(&xs)
    }
}

The result of the program:

And of course, the code of the function where the training takes place:

    let sgd = candle_nn::SGD::new(varmap.all_vars(), LEARNING_RATE);

        let loss = loss::nll(&log_sm, &train_results)?;
        sgd.backward_step(&loss)?;

        let test_logits = model.forward(&test_votes)?;
        let sum_ok = test_logits
            .argmax(D::Minus1)?
            .eq(&test_results)?
            .to_dtype(DType::F32)?
            .sum_all()?
            .to_scalar::<f32>()?;
        let test_accuracy = sum_ok / test_results.dims1()? as f32;
        final_accuracy = 100. * test_accuracy;
        println!("Epoch: {epoch:3} Train loss: {:8.5} Test accuracy: {:5.2}%",
                 loss.to_scalar::<f32>()?,
                 final_accuracy
        );
        if final_accuracy == 100.0 {
            break;
        }
    }
    if final_accuracy < 100.0 {
        Err(anyhow::Error::msg("The model is not trained well enough."))

        Ok(model)

}
```

In conclusion, I would like to note that this example really clearly demonstrates the basic principles of neural networks. Despite the simplicity of the model, the code shows step by step the process of initializing, training, testing and using a neural network to solve the practical problem of predicting voting results.

Of course, for real applied problems, more complex architectures of neural networks will be required. However, this example is great for learning the basics, after which you can move on to more advanced models and solutions.

In general, this article achieves its goal — to give an understanding of the basic principles of neural networks to developers who are just starting to get acquainted with machine learning. The code is written as simply and clearly as possible. This example can serve as a good starting point for further exploring the possibilities of neural networks.
